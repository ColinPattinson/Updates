# Weeknotes E13
Hi, I’m Colin a product manager working at the Department of Health and Social Care. Each week I’m going to keep a running update of the work I’ve done & things I’ve learned along the way.

## My current priority:
> Helping to procure a team capable of delivering the Healthy Start private beta.

## Wednesday
- retro and sprint planning. Jolly but appeals for more people as team are asked to do a lot. Dreams of recruitment being easier too.
- chasing recruitment people. 
- I’ve created a doc for colleagues in Healthy Start to stick words and terms they aren’t sure what they mean so can translate them. Jargon-busting.
- Lots of time adding to a tech strategy document. Interesting reading and love contributing.
- Chats about flexible working future
- chats about good tech examples task

## Thursday
- chased HR and got good news!! We move forward with recruitment
- went through a future [pre-mortem event](https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/plays/pre-mortem) with colleague from Healthy Start team. Next task is to get people for it.
- Spent some time thinking about re-working the name of Healthy Start. Asked team for contributions and explained what good looks like and why we need to do it. Also soliciting random colleagues to throw their hat in the ring and give suggestions. More the merrier. Will vote on best one and test with users.
- contributed to alternative interview questions. Quite enjoyed thinking through interesting questions to ask people.
- got a new pass for the building. They still use the picture from 2016 even though they made me take a new photo a few months ago. I look like a child.
- updating a new spreadsheet as requested with good tech examples in the world of health and care.

## Friday
- annual leave in Newcastle. [Eatin’ good](https://twitter.com/ColinPattinson/status/1027936514196602880).

## Monday
