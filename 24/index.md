# Weeknotes E09
Hi, I’m Colin a product manager working at the Department of Health and Social Care. Each week I’m going to keep a running update of the work I’ve done & things I’ve learned along the way.

P. S. Job alert for [product managers](https://www.civilservicejobs.service.gov.uk/csr/jobs.cgi?jcode=1588889) & [user researchers](https://www.civilservicejobs.service.gov.uk/csr/jobs.cgi?jcode=1588890). Come join the gang! 24th and 27th of July deadline.

## My current priority:
> Helping to procure a team capable of delivering the Healthy Start private beta.

## Wednesday
- updating people about flexible working. Shared my summary of what I think the situation is right now from my perspective.
- attended a chat about procurement plans that affects flexible working. Very interesting world.
- Q3 planning session. We shared our objectives, had a crit of each others then went through planning for the next sprint.
- plans were made for the next Health Product People event.

## Thursday
- worked on our advert to procure a team for Healthy Start beta. Added a few bits and bobs and looks to be well on its way.
- chatted with new Healthy Start colleague Toni who is up in Mansfield. Great chat, everyone keen and excited to get into beta
- finally got a spare few mins to read through the alpha assessment report for Healthy Start. Gave me a few ideas.
- Final measuring success of public health interventions advisory group meet-up. I chipped in with comments, got invited back for the alpha advisory group so obviously my input wasn’t entirely silly.
- went to the theatre and cried quite a bit at [A Monster Calls](https://www.oldvictheatre.com/whats-on/2018/a-monster-calls).
- saw [our new SoS set his ambition for his tenure at DHSC](https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/matt-hancock-writes-in-the-health-service-journal-about-his-admiration-for-the-nhs-and-its-staff). Flexible working mentioned and lots of other positive stuff for our team.

## Friday
- in early. Office looks a different place at 7:40am on a Friday.
- good post on [testing accessibility](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/testing-for-accessibility). We get this question a lot so nice to see a write up!
- going through Healthy Start stuff and plotting unanswered questions pre-beta and making sure the recommendations from the alpha assessment are captured. Working on this is genuinely exciting. Feel like I can help the team get in a good place with a bit of work upfront.
- chatted with colleague Isaac about which parts of Healthy Start he can help out with. Very kindly signed up to join the mission.
- next [health product people event](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/health-product-people-meetup-how-to-work-with-suppliers-tickets-48022833588) up on eventbrite.
- applying for the future leader scheme.
- wrote a draft memorandum of understanding for the Healthy Start team - basically made explicit what I think my support will be for the next few months and set a time when we can review my support.
- first draft of another blog that I’ve been meaning to write for aaaaaggggesss...

## Monday
- I went to [OneTeamGov Global](https://twitter.com/hashtag/OneTeamGovGlobal?src=hash)
- I attended chats about how to embed AI and data science in the civil service, how to push back against policies that hurt vulnerable citizens & mandatory open gov - what would that entail. Also took a break over lunch and learned how to knit. Very very very happy to get a copy of [Digital Transformation at Scale: Why the Strategy](http://londonpublishingpartnership.co.uk/digital-transformation-at-scale/) by Andrew Greenway et al.

## Tuesday
- wrote up a review of OneTeamGov Global
- our advert for [Healthy Start went live!](https://www.digitalmarketplace.service.gov.uk/digital-outcomes-and-specialists/opportunities/7246) Woah amazing suppliers please bid now.
- added more to our Healthy Start to do list. It’s bulging. 
- chatted about flexible working
- read up on [Talk To Frank](https://www.talktofrank.com/) for an assessment
- finished the first draft of a memorandum of understanding. [Dharmesh](https://twitter.com/dharmz23) always a great help who shared his draft MOU.
- finished the blog about how to co-create a vision statement. Out soon!

## What I've been reading
1. [This account of the past and present of the NHS is beautifully written](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jun/24/nhs-cultural-revolution-health-service-staff-patients) (perhaps unsurprising due to the author being a poet). 
2. The [future of GOV.UK](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2018/06/27/building-the-gov-uk-of-the-future/), wise thoughts. [Design system also released](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2018/06/22/introducing-the-gov-uk-design-system/) for teams across Government to use.
3. When space travel and healthcare collide! [New fund to refit space tech into healthcare](https://www.digitalhealth.net/2018/07/nhs-england-looks-to-the-cosmos-for-innovation-drive/). Will think long and hard about my pitch.
4. In-depth [look into what we mean as “privacy”](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/06/18/why-do-we-care-so-much-about-privacy). Spoiler - we are inconsistent. 
5. When [team interactions go wrong and how to avoid them](https://medium.com/pminsider/five-mistakes-product-teams-make-when-collaborating-d3bc224ec7ca). We’ve all been in these situations before.
6. Bees [understand the concept of zero as a number](http://theconversation.com/bees-join-an-elite-group-of-species-that-understands-the-concept-of-zero-as-a-number-97316).
7. The idea of [incremental small wins and slow government](https://www.fastcodesign.com/90175385/why-slow-innovation-is-the-way-forward). Good read. Part of the [Government fix series](https://www.fastcodesign.com/section/the-government-fix).
8. Very thorough [guide on digital inclusion in healthcare by NHS Digital!](https://digital.nhs.uk/about-nhs-digital/our-work/digital-inclusion) Sooooo many interesting links.
