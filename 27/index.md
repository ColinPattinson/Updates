# Weeknotes E12
Hi, I’m Colin a product manager working at the Department of Health and Social Care. Each week I’m going to keep a running update of the work I’ve done & things I’ve learned along the way.

## My current priority:
> Helping to procure a team capable of delivering the Healthy Start private beta.

## Wednesday
- got the list of suppliers for Health Start beta!! Next up to sift them...
- Went to product people event.
- added to our list of health tech companies
- began write up of an email to send to head honchos about service register stuff. Basically asking them to tell me what services we actually own in the department.

## Thursday
- did a first stab at measures of success for our Product People events
- Health procurement chats. Acronym-tastic!
- lunch and learn about briefings, submissions and went back into the world of Parliamentary Questions.
- Fleming Fund assessment report seems to have been agreed. To be published...
- Job panel-related tasks and scoring. Always fun to see [the ever-brilliant Lisa](https://twitter.com/lisa_e_scott?lang=en) for a chat.
- booked the room and sorted out the date for the next Product People event

## Friday
- created a healthy start stakeholder map using the agile team onion. Very much influenced by [Emily Webber](https://emilywebber.co.uk/agile-team-onion-many-pizzas-really-take-feed-team/).
- we prioritised who to target next and sent out emails to lawyers and colleagues in other departments
- we have a rough plan to blog and show and tell for other stakeholders
- [Sadiq Kahn promotes Healthy Start!](https://www.london.gov.uk/what-we-do/business-and-economy/food/have-your-say-draft-london-food-strategy) Thanks Sadiq. I’m free for a chat anytime.
- [Blog published!](https://digitalhealth.blog.gov.uk/2018/08/03/health-product-people-what-does-a-good-supplier-look-like/) Some nifty updates about working with suppliers! Thanks to all the speakers.
- chat about flexible working being set up.
- Talking about our list of health tech companies with interested parties

## Monday
- Annual leave. Enjoying the sunny British coast and a few hours in Exeter.
- [Fleming Fund report](https://digitalhealth.blog.gov.uk/2018/08/06/fleming-fund-beta-service-assessment/) published!

## Tuesday
- getting access to systems for recruitment purposes. Got a feeling this might be more complicated then applying for jobs.
- sifting prospective suppliers for Healthy Start beta. My eyes hurt. I did them all. In one day. Brain melting.
- chasing various HR people. Repeatedly. This recruitment admin is as hard as I suspected it would be.

## What I've been reading
This list is now quite a few weeks old! Sorry, I have a list of intersting things I've read and I'm going to do a bumper edition next week to clear house!

1. [Citizens Advice go beyond branding things digital](https://wearecitizensadvice.org.uk/to-take-the-next-step-on-digital-we-dropped-the-word-digital-14b09ec2f25f) want to make the experience of using Citizens Advice as seamless, easy, and effective as possible.
2. Australian Gov suggesting it needs [more in-house digital expertise and to out-source less](https://www.themandarin.com.au/95019-aps-must-stop-outsourcing-senate-digital-transformation-report/).
3. Re-read this about [when to do research and the questions you should ask yourself](https://pds.blog.parliament.uk/2018/05/14/are-you-ready-for-user-research/) by excellent ex-colleague.
4. What makes [good digital leadership](https://medium.com/ontariodigital/unreasonably-aspirational-leadership-in-a-digital-age-8dda4d07e0). Like the advice to embrace the chaos.
