# Weeknotes E14
Hi, I’m Colin a product manager working at the Department of Health and Social Care. Each week I’m going to keep a running update of the work I’ve done & things I’ve learned along the way.

## My current priority:
> Helping to procure a team capable of delivering the Healthy Start private beta.

## Wednesday
- back from holiday
- on a job panel for PHE for a senior service designer role. Good experience, lovely panel and great candidates. Job offered and accepted already I believe.
- had extra tasks for our DHSC product management job to do
- double-checked some ministerial submissions for a colleague
- caught up on emails

## Thursday
- crit’d our teams capability offer. Inspiration from network theory of power/influence came flooding back as to who we should target. Hunt for the most influential not the highest in the organisation.
- another day, another job panel. This time for our DHSC product manager job.
- sent sift scores for suppliers. Collective sift next week. 
- came up with reverse mentor agenda

## Friday
- spent most of the day trying to help a colleague with the tech vision strategy doc.
- had my third reverse mentoring session and it was great. Gave my summary of what life has been like with a new secretary of state since we last met, a bit on roadmaps and snuck in some advice about where other training is available. Really nice to hear when your advice or suggestions go into practice. Rewarding!

## Monday
- Worked on the tech vision strategy doc once more. Plugging away at it, a tiny bit in the blind but hopefully making incremental improvements.
- tried to answer a tricky question on how much Healthy Start will cost over the next 5 years. TL;DR: we cannot know. I tried listing things that we need to take into account and reiterated that live doesn’t mean finished.
- mini-team planning and advice about surveys. 

## Tuesday
- deadline day for tech vision strategy doc. Moving deadlines but got some extra help from colleagues and worked on it for 60% of the day.
- made the deadline. People seemed pleased with progress from where it was on Friday.
- read the an interim report from pilots around flexible working. Some interesting findings.

## What I've been reading
1. Good deep look into [the worlds of Alibaba and Tencent](http://fortune.com/longform/alibaba-tencent-china-internet/) and how their businesses are beginning to overlap.
2. [How Wakefield tackled Childhood Obesity](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-b8f8b427-deea-46df-b207-2bf1fe7c3a66). Very interesting to read more into the context around Healthy Start. Need to make sure they link together.
3. Enjoyed reading [the agile comms suggestions](http://www.defra.net/home/a-guide-to-agile-communication). Hi, I’m Colin and i am naughty and failed on one of the blogging tips. Plus, [Agile and comms](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/leaning-towards-agile-meg-rowley/) in NHS Digital!
4. [Sharing data for research (relevant to healthcare)](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/science-wants-your-data/), highlights that we need to get better at explaining why we are collecting it in the first place and what the results are. Quote: “People really do want to know the results of research they participate in, he said. But sharing results isn’t a normal part of how scientists deal with human subjects.” [Organisations exist](http://dateva.biz/) to push for more healthcare data to be shared.
5. [How to Foster Psychological Safety in Remote Teams](http://futureofwork.nobl.io/future-of-work/how-to-foster-psychological-safety-in-remote-teams)
6. [Move fast and fix things - how to be a public entrepreneur](https://www.thersa.org/discover/publications-and-articles/rsa-blogs/2018/07/how-to-be-a-public-entrepreneur)
7. Why one doctor is [returning to the NHS](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/aug/02/turned-back-new-zealand-return-work-nhs-ed-patrick) after time off.
8. Professor chats to [wealthy gang contemplating fleeing](https://medium.com/s/futurehuman/survival-of-the-richest-9ef6cddd0cc1), suggests we should be putting our efforts into building a better world.
