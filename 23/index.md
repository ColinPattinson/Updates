# Weeknotes E08
Hi, I’m Colin a product manager working at the Department of Health and Social Care. Each week I’m going to keep a running update of the work I’ve done & things I’ve learned along the way.

P. S. Job alert for [product managers](https://www.civilservicejobs.service.gov.uk/csr/jobs.cgi?jcode=1588889) & [user researchers](https://www.civilservicejobs.service.gov.uk/csr/jobs.cgi?jcode=1588890). Come join the gang! Deadlines are the 24th and 27th of July.

## My current priority:
> Helping to procure a team capable of delivering the Healthy Start private beta.

## Wednesday
- in a minor bike accident as a young girl ran out into the road. Shoes flew off but thankfully all limbs kept in place. Had a bruise on my thigh all week. Close shave.
- video game themed retro. I had lots of positives and thanks to share. Happy gang.
- planning for firebreak week. I am taking ownership of the Service Register for our department. Going to see if we can have an authoritative list of services delivered within our department. Already emailed the GDS Registers team. [Not dissimilar to this](https://hodigital.blog.gov.uk/2018/06/07/creating-a-list-of-services/). 
- Chat with Healthy Start Service Manager. Embedding into the team.
- got a new laptop. Snap review - battery is poo but it is much sleeker.
- gave advice about the alpha phase and what a team could do.
- gave advice on a procurement doc for the Healthy Start team.
- gave advice to a team who report on projects to senior management about a workshop they want to run. Gave lots of examples and encouraging they are talking to users.

## What I've been reading
1. [Looking at NHS leaflets and booklets from 1948](https://blog.mattedgar.com/2018/07/01/5-july-1948-a-chance-and-a-challenge/) - really interesting and fascinating how the challenges remain so similar.
2. [Ministers back new govtech accelerator programme](http://www.ukauthority.com/news/8353/ministers-back-new-govtech-accelerator-programme). It includes [a secure messaging app for those working in hospitals](https://forwardhealth.co/). Maybe our team should replace slack. Also includes a [flexible working app for clinicians](http://locumtap.com/) & a [social care helper](http://kraydel.com/).
3. [Like these posters from the cross-Government content conference](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oRPg8oVbdf4h07iS0bSlX4QVT4GSPl9C/view). Worth printing if you ever need to highlight the importance of content to any sort of service or product.
4. [Review of Parliament restaurant](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jul/01/house-of-commons-london-a-nasty-taste-in-my-mouth-restaurant-review). Get down to the canteen and you can get a roast for a fiver.
5. Beautiful video on US wealth distribution and inequality. [Don’t focus on the 1% vs 99%](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=179&v=hb28kAavh0M).
6. Fascinating read on the [end of the nation state](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/apr/05/demise-of-the-nation-state-rana-dasgupta) and ideas on what we must build next.
7. Staff shortages in nursing [one of the biggest causes why nurses leave](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/nurse-nhs-staff-patients-paperwork-bureaucracy-healthcare-funding-crisis-a8347611.html). Vicious cycle.
8. [Local gov digital vs central gov digital](http://philrumens.blogspot.com/2018/03/a-rough-guide-to-central-vs-local.html?m=1). Informative reminder of the challenges in local gov. [Lots of services they deliver!!](https://standards.esd.org.uk/?uri=list%2FenglishAndWelshServices&tab=children)
