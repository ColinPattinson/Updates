# Weeknotes E06
Hi, I’m Colin a product manager working at the Department of Health and Social Care. Each week I’m going to keep a running update of the work I’ve done & things I’ve learned along the way.

## My current priority:
> Talk to teams who have requested help & see which is the most valuable and viable to help first.

## Wednesday
- retrospective time
- sprint planning to prep for the week
- joyous stottie lunch. Every team needs more stotties in their lives.
- I met with a colleague about the review I am doing. We shared notes and I promised to help answer any questions about all things digital 
- a great thing about the department is that our perm sec runs a series of chats with civil servants in the department. They are completely open and you can ask him anything. There was a great chat and hope I get the chance to turn up at another one soon.

## Thursday
- More reviewing. Finished off going through the new version of the document. Jotted down all my preliminary questions and comments.
- Joined the call for the nhs online show and tell. Good stuff about accessibility & inclusion in there, among other things.
- popped out the office for a quick product catch up. Chatted with former product colleagues about challenges and constructive steps forward.

## Friday
- Annual leave. Off to the wonderful Norway!

## Monday
- re-worded my comments and questions and shared them with the wider team for input
- had a show and tell from Lloyds banking about service design & bits about system thinking
- it is time for writing objectives. So bashed out a first draft.
- read up and shared a great intranet alpha report from ex-colleague [Dia](https://twitter.com/dn78).

## Tuesday
- got brilliant comments from team about my comments and questions and did once last re-write and submitted them to the team.
- had a chat about adult social care data work. Plans forming and tried to share my knowledge of what other teams are doing
- tried to sum it up and send to snr colleagues
- support/assurance planning. Lots of requests for work!
- catch-up and chat about how to improve the objectives I wrote down the day before
